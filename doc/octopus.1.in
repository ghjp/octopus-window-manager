A summary of commands is included below.
.TP
.BI attach
Pop the most recent window from the stack and place it onto the current desktop.
.TP
.BI attach\-all
Pop all remaining windows from the stack and place them onto the current desktop.
.TP
.BI client\-next
Set input focus to the next client of the current desktop. This command
ignores the grouping of the clients by frames. If you want to focus the next
frame use the command \fBframe\-next\fR.
.TP
.BI delete\-client
Kill the actually focused client gracefully.
.TP
.BI detach
Push the actually focused client onto the top of the window stack
.TP
.BI dump\-state

.I command
in the background. This action is normally used to start a GUI application
like a web browser.

this command helps you to reach this goal.
.TP
.BI frame\-attach
Pop the most recent window from the stack and place it into the actually
focused frame.

.SS KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
.B octopus
is optimized for a keyboard centric working model. Especially software engineers who have to write
a lot of code or system administrators will benefit from the keyboard mode. To distinguish the shortcuts
for the window manager from the keys for the applications a modifier key is used by \fBoctopus\fR. The default one is the \fIAlt\fR key. But you can redefine this key by the configuration file. An excellent
alternative on Unix machines is the \fIWindows\fR key. The following shortcuts inside \fBoctopus\fR
are defined:
.TP

.SS MOUSE CONTROLS
Every shown frame consists of a titlebar. This titlebar has 2 buttons on the left
and right side. In between these 2 buttons is an area which shows a tab for each client
bound to that frame.
.TP
.BI "Left button area"
If the
.I left mouse button
is pressed on this area, the
.BI detach
action is performed on the client.
.br
If the
.I middle mouse button
is pressed on this area, the
.BI attach
action is performed on the client.
.br
If the
.I right mouse button
is pressed on this area, the
.BI frame\-attach
action is performed on the client.
If the
.I input wheel
is used on this button, the action
.BI frame\-client\-next
is triggered.
.TP
.BI "Right button area"
If the
.I left mouse button
is pressed on this area, the
.BI delete\-client
action is performed on the client.
.br
If the
.I middle mouse button
is pressed on this area, the
.BI maximize\-full
or
.BI unmaximize\-full
action is performed on the frame. It depends on the current state of the frame what will happen.
It toggles the frame from maximized to normal size.
.br
If the
.I right mouse button
is pressed on this area, the
.BI toggle\-sticky
action is performed on the client.
If the
.I input wheel
is used on this button, the action
.BI raise
or
.BI lower
is triggered. Which one is used depends on the direction the input wheel is scrolled.
.TP
.BI "Titlebar area"
If the
.I left mouse button
is pressed and hold on this area, the frame can be moved interactively.
.br
If the
.I middle mouse button
is pressed and hold on this area, the corresponding client can be dragged onto another frame.
If the mouse is released afterwards a
.BI frame\-attach
is done by the window manager.
If the mouse is released on the root window a simple
.BI attach
is done.
.br
If the
.I right mouse button
is pressed and hold on this area, the frame can be resized interactively.
If the press happens in the middle of the titlebar you can resize the frame
to the north direction. If it occurs on the left part, the resize will be possible
in both north and west direction. The right part allows you to resize the frame
in north and east direction.
.br
If the
.I input wheel
is used on this area, the action
.BI raise
or
.BI lower
is triggered. Which one is used depends on the direction the input wheel is scrolled.
.PP
Moreover the mouse can be used in combination with the modifier key inside the frame
to resize and move it or to attach/detach a client to/from a frame.
.TP
.BI Mod\-Left_Btn
Move a frame interactively.
.TP
.BI Mod\-Right_Btn
Resize a frame interactively. It depends on the area where the mouse click happens in which
direction the frame can be resized. The window area is divided into 9 areas. Simply try it out
and you get a guess how it works.
.TP
.BI Mod\-Middle_Btn
The corresponding client can be dragged onto another frame.
If the mouse is released afterwards a
.BI frame\-attach
is done by the window manager.
If the mouse is released on the root window a simple
.BI attach
is done.
.TP
.BI Mod\-Scroll_wheel
Either the action
.BI raise
or
.BI lower
is triggered. Which one is used depends on the direction the input wheel is scrolled.
.SH NOTES
When it receives a SIGUSR1,
.B octopus
restarts itself again. This means it performs a
.BI restart
action.
